    <h1>This is a motherfucking landing page.</h1>

    <p>
      And it’s about a fucking service that moves your shitty coins between
      crypto exchanges.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Seriously, why would you pay 50 motherfucking dollars just to update a few
      shitty database records?
    </h2>

    <p>The whole fucking thing is plain <strong>stupid</strong></p>

    <p>
      If you store the coins in a centralized exchange, then why bother moving
      them in a decentralized permissionless mumbo jumbo way?
    </p>
    <h2>The service is called <strong>Bransfer</strong></h2>
    <p>And the idea behind it is fucking simple:</p>
    <p>
      You send your coins to our address in one exchange. Then we
      send the same coins back from our address in the
      other exchange.
    </p>
<blockquote>
<p>- "Wait what?? Send to your address? What if you don't keep your word? What if you don't send me back my coins?"</p>
<p>- "Well, that's an excellent question coming from a moron who stores their fortune in a non-regulated, centralized exchange. If you can trust them, why wouldn't you trust <a href="https://bransfer.io/about-us/">us</a>?"</p>
</blockquote>

    <p>It's supported in your favorite big-ass exchanges: Binance and Huobi.</p>
    <h3 id="and-guess-what-motherfucker">And guess what, motherfucker:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Shit’s <em>fucking</em> fast;</li>
      <li>It costs less than your stupid morning mochaccino.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>And as the saying goes...</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>“Whatever is faster and cheaper is better.” — A smart motherfucker</p>
