    <h1>This is a motherfucking landing page</h1>

    <p>
      And it’s about a fucking service that moves your shitty coins from centralized exchanges to L2s and back.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Seriously, why would you waste 50 motherfucking dollars on bridge toll, when you can waste it on literally anything else?
    </h3>

    <p>The whole fucking thing is plain <strong>stupid</strong>.</p>

    <p>
      If you store the coins in a centralized exchange, then why bother moving them in a decentralized permissionless mumbo jumbo way?
    </p>
    
    <h2>The service is called <strong>Layerswap</strong></h2>
    <p>And the idea behind it is fucking simple:</p>
    <p>
      We hodl lots of crypto in L2s and centralized exchanges.
    </p>
    <p>
      You send your coins to our address in centralized exchange. Then we
      send the same amount of coins to your L2 address.
    </p>
    
    <p>It's supported in your favorite big-ass exchanges like Coinbase, Binance, FTX.COM and networks like StarkNet, Arbitrum, Optimism, zkSync, Loopring.</p>
    <h3 id="and-guess-what-motherfucker">And guess what, motherfucker:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Shit’s <em>fucking</em> fast;</li>
      <li>It costs less than your stupid morning mochaccino.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>And as the saying goes...</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>“Whatever is faster and cheaper is better.” — A smart motherfucker</p>
