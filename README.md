# This is a motherfucking landing page.

And it’s about a fucking service that moves your shitty coins from centralized exchanges to L2s and back.

## Seriously, why would you pay 50 motherfucking dollars just to update a few shitty database records?

The whole fucking thing is plain **stupid**

If you store the coins in a centralized exchange, then why bother moving them in a decentralized permissionless mumbo jumbo way?

## The service is called **Layerswap**

And the idea behind it is plain stupid:

You send your coins to our address in a centralized exchange. Then we send the same coins back to your L2 address.

It's supported in your favorite big-ass exchanges: Coinbase, FTX.COM, KuCoin, Binance, Huobi and more.

### And guess what, motherfucker:

*   Shit’s _fucking_ fast;
*   It costs less than your stupid morning mochaccino.

### And as the saying goes...

> “Whatever is faster and cheaper is better.” — A smart motherfucker
