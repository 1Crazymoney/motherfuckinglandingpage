# This is a motherfucking landing page.

And it’s about a fucking service that moves your shitty crypto between motherfucking exchanges.

## Seriously, why would you pay 50 motherfucking dollars just to update a few shitty database records?

The whole fucking thing is plain **stupid**

If you store the coins in a centralized exchange, then why bother moving them in a descentralzied permissionless mumbo jumbo way?

## The service is called **Bransfer**

And the idea behind it is plain stupid:

You send your coins to our motherfucking address in one exchange. Then we send the same coins back from our next motherfucking address from the other shitty exchange.

It's supported in your favorite big-ass exchanges: Binance and Huobi.

### And guess what, motherfucker:

*   Shit’s _fucking_ fast;
*   It costs less than your stupid morning moccachino.

### And as the saying goes...

> “Whatever is faster and cheaper is better.” — A smart motherfucker
